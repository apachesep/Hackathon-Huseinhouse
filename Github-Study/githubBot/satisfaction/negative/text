The youth of today are constantly immersed in technological advancements that promote nonstop communication and instant gratification
whether through cell phones, gaming systems, laptops, or MP3 players. But are these technological advancements a good thing
Technology is a negative influence on us because it separates individuals from reality
The ability for people to surround themselves with the familiar by using their iPod is appealing because it rarely provides the listener with something unexpected or unknown
it can be argued that this is a bad thing
constantly being cut off from personal interactions and new experiences because of a technological device
hinders personal communication, which negatively impacts our age-group
Internet actually detracts from the communication abilities of society, especially the young
our communication skills are gradually lessened
negatively affects us by perpetuating the mindset of immediate satisfaction
creation of various portable technological devices has slowly ingrained the idea of instant gratification

spreads the concept of instant gratification
must be able to utilize technology while not allowing it to impede social interactions, particularly for those who are easily influenced during our formative years
world must learn to embrace technology without allowing it to negatively impact the creation of functional adults in society
