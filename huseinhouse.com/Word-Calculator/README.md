2. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
3. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
4. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
5. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
6. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
7. The Hunger Games
8. Catching Fire
9. Game of Throne

### Please do not pirate those books like I am, support Original.
